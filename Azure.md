## What is Choclatley


Chocolatey can be used to install and manage software packages on computers running Windows, including those that are used in an Azure environment. As a package manager, Chocolatey simplifies the process of installing and updating software by automating the process of downloading, extracting, and installing packages from a central repository.

In the context of Azure, Chocolatey might be used to install tools or libraries that are required for developing or deploying applications to the Azure platform. It could also be used to install and manage other software packages that are needed to support the operation of Azure workloads.

For example, you might use Chocolatey to install the Azure CLI (Command Line Interface), which is a set of command-line tools that you can use to manage Azure resources, or to install a specific version of the .NET framework, which might be required to run an application that is deployed to Azure.
