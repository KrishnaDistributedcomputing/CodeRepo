## What is Choclatley


Chocolatey can be used to install and manage software packages on computers running Windows, including those that are used in an Azure environment. As a package manager, Chocolatey simplifies the process of installing and updating software by automating the process of downloading, extracting, and installing packages from a central repository.

In the context of Azure, Chocolatey might be used to install tools or libraries that are required for developing or deploying applications to the Azure platform. It could also be used to install and manage other software packages that are needed to support the operation of Azure workloads.

For example, you might use Chocolatey to install the Azure CLI (Command Line Interface), which is a set of command-line tools that you can use to manage Azure resources, or to install a specific version of the .NET framework, which might be required to run an application that is deployed to Azure.

To install the Azure CLI using Chocolatey, you can use the following command:

```powershell
choco install azure-cli
```
This will install the Azure CLI and all of its dependencies using Chocolatey. Once the installation is complete, you can use the Azure CLI by opening a command prompt and typing "az".

Here are some examples of how you can use the Azure CLI to manage Azure resources:

List all of the resource groups in your Azure subscription:
```cli
az group list
```
Create a new resource group:
```cli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```
Deploy a new virtual machine:
```
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
```
These are just a few examples of the many commands that are available with the Azure CLI. You can find more information about using the Azure CLI in the Azure documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/.
