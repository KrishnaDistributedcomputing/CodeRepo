## Different type of URLS in Django
There are several types of URLs that you can use in a Django web application. Some common examples include:

* http://: This is the most common type of URL, and it stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used to access web pages over the internet using a web browser.

* https://: This is a secure version of http, and stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is used to access web pages over the internet using a secure connection.

* ftp://: This stands for File Transfer Protocol, and it is used to transfer files between computers over a network.

* file://: This is used to access files on a local computer or network.

* telnet://: This is used to connect to a remote computer using a command-line interface.

## INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 

In Django, INSTALLED_APPS is a list of strings that specify the names of all the Django applications that are installed in your project. This list is used by Django to discover and load the various applications that make up your project.

To include a new app in your Django project, you will need to add its name to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the settings.py file. The name should be the name of the app's Python module, without the .py extension.

For example, if you have an app called myapp, you would add it to INSTALLED_APPS like this:

Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'myapp',
]
Once you have added the app to INSTALLED_APPS, you will need to run the makemigrations and migrate management commands to create the necessary database tables and perform any other setup tasks that are required by the app.

It's important to note that the order of the apps in INSTALLED_APPS matters. Django processes the apps in the order that they appear in the list, and this can affect the way that the app is discovered and loaded. For example, if one app depends on another, the dependent app should appear after the app that it depends on in INSTALLED_APPS.


## Different Types of Views in Django
In Django, a view is a Python function or method that takes a web request and returns a web response. The response can be in the form of a HTML template, a redirect, a 404 error, or any other type of HTTP response.

There are several different types of views that you can use in Django, depending on your needs. Some common types of views include:

Function-based views: These are simple Python functions that take a request and return a response. They are the most basic type of view in Django and are easy to use, but they can become unwieldy as the complexity of your application increases.

Class-based views: These are Python classes that provide a more object-oriented approach to handling web requests and responses. They are more flexible and reusable than function-based views and are a good choice when you need to reuse code across multiple views.

Template views: These are views that render a specific HTML template in response to a web request. They are useful for displaying static content, such as a homepage or an about page.

Redirect views: These are views that redirect the user to another URL in response to a web request. They are useful for handling URL redirects or for implementing login or logout functionality.

JSON views: These are views that return a JSON-formatted response to a web request. They are often used for building APIs or for handling AJAX requests from JavaScript clients.

There are also many other types of views that you can use in Django, such as views that handle file downloads, views that handle form submissions, and views that handle error responses.
