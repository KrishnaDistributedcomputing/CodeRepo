## Javascript Event

JavaScript events are actions that occur when a user or browser manipulates an HTML page.
Examples of events include clicking a button, pressing a key, closing a window, and resizing a window. 

Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript code and create responses, such as closing windows, displaying messages, validating data, and more.

There are various event types, including onclick, onsubmit, onmouseover, and onmouseout, as well as standard HTML 5 events such as onerror and onfocus Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and can be triggered by HTML elements. 

It is possible to assign functions to be executed when an event occurs using attributes in HTML, such as onclick or onsubmit.
